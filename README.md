# magnetometer\_compass

Compass based on a 3-axis magnetometer, attitude readings and possibly also GPS.

Because there is no well established Azimuth message in ROS, this node publishes our custom `compass_interfaces/Azimuth`
as well as a few other formats that are capable of carrying orientation information. It also offers the azimuth
values in both radians and degrees, because radians are the ROS standard, while degrees are more used in the
geographic area. There are tens of possible combinations of the output data formats, so each of the published
topics has a boolean parameter that enables it. By default, there is only one enabled output topic.

## Explaining some basic terms

So that you know what output is the right for you.

### Orientation
- NED (North-East-Down): Azimuth will be 0 pointing to north, and increases clockwise. This is consistent with the
  azimuth used in cartography and by tourists.
- ENU (East-North-Up): Azimuth will be 0 pointing to east, and increases counter-clockwise. This is consistent with
  REP-103 and robot_localization package.
### References for north
- Magnetic: points towards the magnetic north of Earth (travels in time).
- Geographic ("true"): points towards the geographic Earth (i.e. the WGS84 North Pole). It is static in time.
- UTM: points in the north direction on the cartesian UTM grid (similar to Geographic, but it can slightly diverge
  at the edges of UTM maps). You probably want this azimuth reference for navigation tasks in UTM coordinates.

Magnetic azimuth can be computed directly from the magnetometer and IMU orientation. To compute the other two
references, you need to provide the latitude, longitude, altitude and time in addition to the magnetometer and
IMU orientation. These are the required inputs to compute magnetic declination and UTM grid convergence, which are
the offsets by which geographic and UTM references differ from the magnetic. This is why this compass node subscribes
to the GPS fix messages. Until at least a single GPS fix message is received, neither geographic- nor UTM-referenced
data are published. If you do not have a GPS receiver, you can alternatively provide these values in parameters.

For the magnetometer to work correctly, it is required to measure its bias. This node listens on the `imu/mag_bias`
topic for this measurement, and until at least one message arrives, the node will not publish anything. If you do not
have a node publishing the bias, you can alternatively provide it via parameters. Depending on the application, it
may be required to re-estimate the bias from time to time even during runtime.

## Node magnetometer\_compass\_nodelet and component node magnetometer\_compass/MagnetometerCompassNodelet

### Subscribed topics
- `imu/data` (`sensor_msgs/Imu`): Output from an IMU or an orientation filtering algorithm. It should have valid
    contents of `orientation` and at least roll and pitch should be estimated as well as possible (relative to the
    gravity vector). These messages should come at the same rate as the magnetometer data (or faster).
- `imu/mag` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`): 3-axis magnetometer raw measurements (bias not removed) (disabled by param
    `~subscribe_mag_unbiased`).
- `imu/mag_bias` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`): Bias of the magnetometer. This value will be subtracted from the
    incoming magnetometer measurements. Messages on this topic do not need to come repeatedly if the bias does not
    change. Disabled by param `~subscribe_mag_unbiased`.
- `imu/mag_unbiased` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`): 3-axis magnetometer unbiased measurements (enabled by param
    `~subscribe_mag_unbiased`).
- `gps/fix` (`sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`, optional): GPS fix messages from which the latitude, longitude, altitude and
    current year can be read. These are further used to compute magnetic declination and UTM grid convergence factor if
    requested.
- TF: This node requires a (usually static) transform between `~frame` and the frame ID of the IMU and magnetometer
    messages.

### Parameters
- All the `publish_*` parameters mentioned above.
- Please note that you cannot combine both `~subscribe_mag_unbiased` and `~publish_mag_unbiased` set to true.
  Such configuration is invalid and the node will not start.
- `~frame` (string, default `base_link`): Frame into which the IMU and magnetometer data should be transformed.
- `~low_pass_ratio` (double, default 0.95): The azimuth is filtered with a low-pass filter. This sets its
    aggressivity (0 means raw measurements, 1 means no updates).
- `~initial_mag_bias_x` (double, no default, optional): Magnetometer bias in the X axis.
- `~initial_mag_bias_y` (double, no default, optional): Magnetometer bias in the Y axis.
- `~initial_mag_bias_z` (double, no default, optional): Magnetometer bias in the Z axis.
  - If you specify any of the `~initial_mag_bias_*` params, the node does not need to receive the bias messages.
- `~initial_lat` (double, no default, optional): Latitude in degrees.
- `~initial_lon` (double, no default, optional): Longitude in degrees.
  - If you specify both `~initial_lat` and `~initial_lon`, the node does not need to receive the GPS fix messages.
- `~initial_alt` (double, default 0): Altitude in meters (it is usually okay to omit it and use the default).
- `~initial_year` (int, no default, optional): If set, overrides the current time for declination computation.
- `~magnetic_declination` (double, no default, optional, radians): If this parameter is set, the magnetic models are
    ignored and this value for declination is forced. This can be useful either if you know the value in advance or in
    simulation.
- `~utm_grid_convergence` (double, no default, optional, radians): If set, forces this value of UTM grid convergence.
- `~magnetic_models_path` (string, defaults to a pre-installed directory): Path where WMM magnetic models can be found.
     If set to empty string, the models will be searched in a default folder of GeographicLib. Environment variables
     `GEOGRAPHICLIB_MAGNETIC_PATH` or `GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA` influence the location of this folder. You usually do not
     need to use other than the preinstalled models. But if you do, specify the path to the custom models directory
     here.
- `~magnetic_model` (string, defaults to autodetection by year): Name of the magnetic field model to use. If omitted,
     an automated decision is made based on the current year (or `~initial_year`, if set). This model is used for
     computing magnetic declination.
- `utm_zone` (int, optional): If set, forces using this UTM zone instead of determining the proper one.
- `keep_utm_zone` (bool, default true): If true, the first determined UTM zone will be used for all future conversions.

## Node visualize\_azimuth\_nodelet and component node magnetometer\_compass::VisualizeAzimuthNodelet

This node visualizes `Azimuth` messages in RViz converting them to a pose.

### Subscribed topics

- `~azimuth` (multiple types supported): The azimuth to visualize. Any type supported by compass_conversions package
    can be used: `compass_interfaces/Azimuth`, `geometry_msgs/Quaternion`, `geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovarianceStamped` or
    `sensor_msgs/Imu`. If other types than `compass_interfaces/Azimuth` are used, either the resolved topic name must contain
    the azimuth type identification (e.g. end with `mag/enu/imu`), or you must provide parameters `~input_reference` and
    `~input_orientation`.
- `gps/fix` (`sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`, optional): GPS fix messages from which the latitude, longitude, altitude and
    current year can be read. These are further used to compute magnetic declination and UTM grid convergence factor.
- `utm_zone` (`std_msgs/Int32`, optional): Optional UTM zone updates.

### Published topics

- `~azimuth_vis` (`sensor_msgs/MagneticField`, enabled by param `~publish_mag_unbiased`, off by default):
  The magnetic field measurement with bias removed.

- `~input_orientation` (str, 'enu' or 'ned', default: unspecified): ENU or NED orientation to be used to interpret
    input messages (in case orientation cannot be derived either from message contents or topic name).
- `~input_reference` (str, 'magnetic', 'geographic' or 'UTM', default: no change): North reference to be used to
    interpret input messages (in case reference cannot be derived either from message contents or topic name).
